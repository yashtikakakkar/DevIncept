## Count Distinct Elements

What we are given in this problem is that we have an array which contains 'n' elements. The elements can be repetitive. We need to find the number of distinct elements present in it and give the count as the output.

#### For example:
<pre>
Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 20, 10, 30, 10}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three distinct elements 10, 20 and 30.

Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 20, 10, 20}
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct elements 10 and 20.
</pre>

There can be 3 methods used for this purpose. We will look at all of them one by one.

### Method 1

### Method 2

### Method 3

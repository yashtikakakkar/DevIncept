Pattern Searching is done when we have to find if a substring (pattern) is present in another string. Hence it is also known as String Searching.

There are many algorithms for Pattern Searching such as:
- Naive Algorithm
- KMP Algorithm
- Raben Karp Algorithm

We will discuss the basic Brute Force Approach ie the Naive Algorithm in this file.
